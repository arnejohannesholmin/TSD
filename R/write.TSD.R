#' and similar for the complex data types.
#'
#' @param x  is the list containing the data to write.
#' @param con  is the connection object or a character string naming the output file.
#' @param t  is a vector of the time steps to write (in the range [1, number of pings]). If none of the elements of 't' are in [1, number of pings], only the header is written. If t == "all", all time points are written and if t == "none", none of the time points are written.
#' @param var  is a vector of the variables to be written, either given as a character vector holding the names of the variables, as specified in the TSD-format, or as the number of the variables in 'labl', if 'labl' is known.

	############### LOG: ###############
	# Start: 2010-02-04 - Clean version.
	# Update: 2010-06-17 - Lots of changes over the last months: (1) Default endianness changed to "big", because endianness is like Colins, "big" is better (and is best for windows, while ok for unix), (2) added the option 'reserve' for reserving header space to append data later, (3) added the C++ method "UpdateHeaderTSD" used when appending data of diffing variable lengths, (4) changed the dimensions of 'lvar' to [numt x nvar], and other stuff.
	# Update: 2010-09-09 - Cleaned up the method of finding 'numt', 'lvar' and treating the variables that do not fit exactly into these.
	# Update: 2010-09-09 - Added support for reading TSD files containing dimension data. Dimension data must be specified as an additional variable named "d000" structured as c(narrays_1, ndims_1, indx_1, dims_1, narrays_2, ndims_2, indx_2, dims_2, ... , narrays_numt, ndims_numt, indx_numt, dims_numt), where 'narrays_p' is the number of variables at time step 'p' that have dimension (vectors are not regarded av having dimension, corresponding to the dim() function), 'ndims_p' is the number of dimensions for each variable at time step 'p', 'indx_p' is the index numbers for the variables that posess dimension at time step 'p', and 'dims_p' are the dimension values for the variables indexed by 'indx_p' at time step 'p', collapsed into a vector. Also added the option 'dimension' for specifying whether dimension should be added to the data, or simply for specifying the dimension. Cleaned up the treatment of differing numbers of time steps for the variables, so that the largest number of time steps extracted from the data is reagarded as the true number of time steps. Arrays not complying with this number of time steps are written as dimensionless vectors at the first time step.
	# Update: 2010-09-22 - Sorted out the addign of dimension through d000. Observed error when writing arrays. The number of dimensions are seeked in the last dimension of arrays in this version. Then the max of the 'numt' of every variable is taken to be the overall 'numt'. This reduces contol over the number of time steps. See the last version for better handling of the number of time steps in variables.
	# Update: 2010-09-22 - Sorted out the treatment of time steps for arrays, through the input 'ts'. 
	# Update: 2011-12-06 - Changed so that the only header variables that can be specified in 'header' are the data types 'dtyp' and the labels 'labl'. The number of variables and the lengths of the variables are extracted from the data in any case. All header variables specified in the data are ignored.
	# Update: 2012-07-31 - Added transformation from double to integer when dtyp == "shrt".
	# Update: 2013-07-16 - Removed 'split_char' and renamed 'collapse_char' to 'split_char'. Also changed the treatment of strings, so that the dimension of a string array is kept at each time step.
	# Update: 2013-07-17 - Added "long" as a data type representing four byte long integer, since "shrt" only applies to integers with values in the range âˆ’32768 to 32767. Integers detected in 'x' are from now on written as "long", and writing integers as "shrt" requires specification of this in the header.
	# Update: 2013-08-07 - Changed to write d000 at every time step (d000 = 0 at time steps where no dimenstion exists for any of the variables).
	# Update: 2013-08-07 - Fixed bug related to d000.
	# Update: 2013-08-13 - Added support for 'x' with variables not present in the existing file, or with order inconsistent with the variable order in the existing file, when append == TRUE.
	# Update: 2013-08-22 - Added 'dup'.
	# Update: 2013-11-11 - Added 'lvar_float'.
	# Update: 2014-01-27 - Fixed bug: When 'numt' was given, it did not have the desired effect on the dimension information. Now, if numt equals the last dimension of a variable, time is assumed along that last dimension, just as if the number of dimensions of a variable is in 'ts'.
	# Update: 2014-02-10 - Removed 'split_char' from the parameters and fixed it to "\u001F" (INFORMATION SEPARATOR ONE). Also added the option of writing functions.
	# Update: 2014-04-24 - Added 'numt_old' for skipping the reading of existing file when appending.
	# Update: 2014-07-02 - Added the function is.doubleTSD_element() to identify variable that should be saved in double presicion.
	# Update: 2014-09-10 - Fixed bug which did not save NA as NA, but as 0.
	# Update: 2014-09-27 - NEW FORMAT: Added the numer of time steps 'numt' in the file as the second long (after 'nvar'), and the number of rows of 'lvar' 'r000' to speed up the reading of the header and appending to the header. Also removed non-binary writing.
	# Update: 2014-12-12 - Added support for complex variables through the data types "cpxf" and "cpxd".
	# Update: 2015-10-01 - Updated to treat stings simply by counting the number of characters (before the split character was included, but in the new version the character variables are collapsed to one sting per time step for each variable before using write.TSD_fun_lvar()).
	# Last: 2016-07-04 - Fixed several bugs related to the use of 'numt' and 't', involving extracting 'lvar', 'singleindex' and dimensions first, and then subsetting these during writing.

	############ VARIABLES: ############
	# ---x--- is the list containing the data to write.
	# ---con--- is the connection object or a character string naming the output file.
	# ---t--- is a vector of the time steps to write (in the range [1, number of pings]). If none of the elements of 't' are in [1, number of pings], only the header is written. If t == "all", all time points are written and if t == "none", none of the time points are written.
	# ---var--- is a vector of the variables to be written, either given as a character vector holding the names of the variables, as specified in the TSD-format, or as the number of the variables in 'labl', if 'labl' is known. If var == "all", all varialbes are written and if var == "none", none of the variables are written.
	# ---header--- is a list containing one or more of the following two elements ("nvar" and "lvar" are always extracted from the data as of 2011-12-06):
	#		"labl" (string vector of length 'nvar': labels of the variables)
	#		"dtyp" (string vector of length 'nvar': TSD data type of the variables). If missing, the header is generated from 'x'.
	# ---numt--- is the number of time points of the data 'x' overriding any existing information about the number of time steps, given in 'header' or 'x' (intended to only be specified if all time steps are arranged in the same vector for all variables).
	# ---dimension--- is an object specifying whether the dimensions of the variables at each time step are to be stored in the file. 'dimension' may have 4 values:
	#		1 - FALSE - no dimension data should be written to file.
	#		2 - TRUE - dimension data to be extracted from the data.
	#		3 - A vector of values specifying the dimensions of the data. These values must agree with the data. Given as c(narrays_1, ndims_1, indx_1, dims_1, narrays_2, ndims_2, indx_2, dims_2, ... , narrays_numt, ndims_numt, indx_numt, dims_numt), where 'narrays_p' is the number of variables at time step 'p' that have dimension (vectors are not regarded av having dimension, corresponding to the dim() function), 'ndims_p' is the number of dimensions for each variable at time step 'p', 'indx_p' is the index numbers for the variables that posess dimension at time step 'p', and 'dims_p' are the dimension values for the variables indexed by 'indx_p' at time step 'p', collapsed into a vector.
	#		4 - A list of 'nvar' lists of lengths 'numt', holding the dimensions of the variables at all time steps.
	# ---ts--- is a numeric vector specifying the rules for regarding the last dimensions of arrays as time: If the number of dimensions of an array is included in the set 'ts' the last dimension of that array is considered to be along time, so that if ts = 3 and we wish to write an array of dimension [3, 4, 2], this array will be written as two [3, 4] arrays. 'ts' is utilized through seq_along(dim(x))[ts], so that if ts = -2 matrices are not regarded as having time along the second dimension.
 	# - ---reserve' is the number of time steps to reserve for future appending to the file (in which case 'reserve' rows of zeros are appended in 'lvar' in the header).
 	# - ---keep.null' is FALSE if elements of length 0 should be discarded from the data, in which case a numerical 'var' would represent indices of 'x' AFTER empty elements have been removed.
 	# - ---dup' is TRUE to allow for duplicated variable label. If dup = FALSE (default) all variables with the same label as a previous variable in the input list 'x' are removed.
 	# - ---endian' is the endian of the file, defaulted to .Platform$endian (changed from "big" by Arne Johannes Holmin 2012-07-31).
	# ---append--- is TRUE if data is to be appended to the end of 'con' (only valid when 'con' is a character string), in which case the header is not written. No check made for compatibility to the existing file.
	# ---ow--- is TRUE if the user wish to overwrite existing file.
	# ---...--- is to allow variables passed on from other methods.
