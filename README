# TSD version: 1.3 (latest beta, 2019-10-15)
# R version: 3.5


# The `TSD` package provides functions for reading, writing and other processing of data in the Time Step Data (TSD) format (and other utilities used by the packages SimradRaw, sonR, cpplot3d and echoIBM).The TSD format was created for the purpose of storing data organized in time steps possibly with different dimensions at different time steps. It was created in 2010 for personal use by the package author, but the NetCDF 4 format or HDF5 format largely covers the functionality of the TSD format.

# Release notes for TSD_1.3:

# 1. Renamed merge_TSD to combine.TSD, to keep the same dot separated naming as read.TSD and write.TSD. merge.TSD is not allowed since there exists a function merge, and using merge.TSD could cause conflicts with S3 methods.

# For historical release notes see https://github.com/StoXProject/TSD/blob/master/NEWS
