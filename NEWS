########## Version 1.0 ##########

The TSD package Provides functions for reading, writing and other processing of data in the Time Step Data (TSD) format (and other utilities used by the packages SimradRaw, sonR, cpplot3d and echoIBM).


########## Version 1.1 ##########

Added the option of reading multiple TSD files with read.TSDs() and returning the data in a list with one element per file.

Moved development to GitHub.

Added the parameter 'use.raw' write.TSD() (and changed the exinsting 'raw' to 'use.raw' in read.TSD). Along with changes to the dimension information d000, this increased speed significantly for many time steps.


########## Version 1.2 ##########

Fixed bug in write.TSD() with writing data frames. Data frames are not supported, and are now converted to matrix with a warning.
